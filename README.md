# Expressium LivingDoc

## Introduction
> Expressium LivingDoc — Reporting, Analytics and Living Documentation for ReqnRoll

Expressium LivingDoc is an open-source tool that combines reporting, analytics, and living documentation
into a single HTML test report for ReqnRoll projects. 
It transforms automated test results into meaningful insights and living documentation. 
The generated test report can be shared with quality and product stakeholders, 
providing clear visibility into the current state of product quality.

## Target Frameworks

The `Expressium.LivingDoc` core library targets `.NET 8.0` and `.NET Framework 4.7.2`.
The Reqnroll plugin, CLI, unit tests, and UI tests target `.NET 8.0` because their
Reqnroll and test dependencies are not part of the `.NET Framework` compatibility target.
The core library has been compile-validated for both targets. Running `.NET Framework 4.7.2`
applications and tests requires Windows with the .NET Framework runtime installed.

## Getting Started
Once you have created a ReqnRoll test project, integrating Expressium LivingDoc is straightforward.
Simply add the Expressium LivingDoc PlugIn NuGet package to your project and configure the ReqnRoll formatter. 
The formatter configuration supports relative paths and predefined ReqnRoll substitution variables.

* Add the Expressium.LivingDoc.ReqnrollPlugin NuGet package to the ReqnRoll test project...
* Setup the Expressium formatters properties in the ReqnRoll configuration in the test project...
* Run the tests in the ReqnRoll test project and open the HTML report in the output directory...

***NuGet Package***
```bash
dotnet add package Expressium.LivingDoc.ReqnrollPlugin
```

***ReqnRoll.json***
```json
{
  "$schema": "https://schemas.reqnroll.net/reqnroll-config-latest.json",
  "formatters": {
    "expressium": {
      "outputFilePath": "LivingDoc.ndjson",
      "outputFileTitle": "Expressium.Coffeeshop.Web.API.Tests",
      "outputDirectory": ".",
      "outputFileName": "LivingDoc.html",
      "mergeWithHistory": true
    }
  }
}
```

`outputDirectory` and `outputFileName` control the generated HTML path and support
relative or absolute values. `mergeWithHistory` defaults to `true` when `historyPath`
is configured; set it to `false` to generate the current report without importing
historical results. Execution timestamps are retained as UTC instants and displayed
as GMT values in the report.

The repository includes a small Reqnroll compatibility fixture containing both a
regular Scenario and a Scenario Outline. Its Windows GitHub Actions job executes the
fixture and publishes the generated `LivingDoc.html` and `LivingDoc.ndjson` files as
the `expressium-livingdoc-reqnroll-report` artifact.

## History Analysis
The Expressium LivingDoc report can optionally include historical test results 
based on previous Cucumber Messages files.
Historical test results are visualized as trends in Analytics
along with a date-based status list within each scenario.

An additional health status — Broken, Regressed, Flaky, New, or Fixed —
is derived from historical results and displayed in the scenario tags.
The history analysis is limited to the four most recent test runs.
In a pipeline, the previous Cucumber message files
must be preserved in the history folder before executing the tests.

***ReqnRoll.json***
```json
{
  "$schema": "https://schemas.reqnroll.net/reqnroll-config-latest.json",
  "formatters": {
    "expressium": {
      "outputFilePath": "LivingDoc.ndjson",
      "outputFileTitle": "Expressium.Coffeeshop.Web.API.Tests",
      "historyPath": "History/*.ndjson"
    }
  }
}
```

## Scenario Attachments
Since the AddAttachment API in ReqnRoll doesn’t support adding attachments as external links,
we need to use a workaround to enable attachments in the Expressium LivingDoc report.
Scenario attachments, such as log files and screenshots, can be stored in a relative location
and added as links to simplify distribution afterwards.

***ReqnRollExtensions.cs***
```c#
using Reqnroll;

namespace MyCompany.MyProject.Web.API.Tests
{
    internal static class ReqnRollExtensions
    {
        internal static void AddAttachmentAsLink(this IReqnrollOutputHelper outputHelper, string path)
        {
            outputHelper.WriteLine($"[Attachment: {path}]");
        }
    }
}
```

<br />

***BaseHook.cs***
```c#
[AfterScenario]
public void AfterScenario()
{
    FinalizeFixture();

    if (configuration.Loggings)
    {
        var fileName = Path.Combine(Folders.Loggings.ToString(), GetTestName() + ".log");
        reqnrollOutputHelper.AddAttachmentAsLink(fileName);
    }

    if (configuration.Screenshots)
    {
        var fileName = Path.Combine(Folders.Screenshots.ToString(), GetTestName() + ".png");
        reqnrollOutputHelper.AddAttachmentAsLink(fileName);
    }
}
```

## Command Line Interface
For many different purposes, it may be desirable to customize the final Expressium LivingDoc test report.
You can achieve this by creating a separate custom CLI project, adding a project reference to the ReqnRoll test project
and implementing any logic needed to handle your specific reporting requirements.
For other examples of custom CLI implementations, 
please refer to the Expressium LivingDoc CLI project and batch files in this repository.

***Program.cs***
```c#
if (args.Length == 7 && args[0] == "--custom")
{
    // Generating a custom LivingDoc Test Report based on a Cucumber Messages NDJSON file...
    Console.WriteLine("");
    Console.WriteLine("Generating LivingDoc Test Report...");
    Console.WriteLine("Input: " + args[2]);
    Console.WriteLine("Output: " + args[4]);
    Console.WriteLine("Title: " + args[6]);

    var livingDocConverter = new LivingDocConverter();
    var livingDocProject = livingDocConverter.Convert(args[2], args[6]);

    // Omitting overview folders...
    foreach (var feature in livingDocProject.Features)
        feature.Uri = null;

    livingDocConverter.Generate(livingDocProject, args[4]);

    Console.WriteLine("Generating LivingDoc Report Completed");
    Console.WriteLine("");
}
```

## Merging Reports
The ReqnRoll test execution may run across multiple pipelines
and it is desirable to produce a single consolidated test report.
A merging of test reports can be achieved through a separate CLI program.
Only new and previously unknown features will be included during the merge process.

***Program.cs***
```c#
if (args.Length == 8 && args[0] == "--merge")
{
    // Generating a LivingDoc Test Report based on Two Cucumber Messages NDJSON files...
    Console.WriteLine("");
    Console.WriteLine("Generating LivingDoc Test Report...");
    Console.WriteLine("InputMaster: " + args[2]);
    Console.WriteLine("InputSlave: " + args[3]);
    Console.WriteLine("Output: " + args[5]);
    Console.WriteLine("Title: " + args[7]);

    var livingDocConverter = new LivingDocConverter();
    var livingDocProject = livingDocConverter.Convert(args[2], args[7]);
    livingDocConverter.MergeProject(livingDocProject, args[3]);
    livingDocConverter.Generate(livingDocProject, args[5]);

    Console.WriteLine("Generating LivingDoc Report Completed");
    Console.WriteLine("");
}
```

## Deep Linking
When the Expressium LivingDoc report is opened in a browser,
the onload event automatically reads URL query parameters and applies filters accordingly.
This enables direct linking to specific scenarios or features filtered by keywords within the LivingDoc report.

***DeepLinking.bat***
```bat
start chrome "file:///C://Company/LivingDoc.html?filterByKeywords=TA-3001"
```

</p>

## The LivingDoc Process
The Expressium LivingDoc process uses the Reqnroll PlugIn to capture test execution results and output them as Cucumber Messages (NDJSON).
These messages are parsed into an object-oriented model, which the Generator transforms into a self-contained HTML LivingDoc test report.
